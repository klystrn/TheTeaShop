# TheTeaShop #
Founded by Reginald Tan & Jerel Sim in 2021, The Tea Shop is passionately dedicated to tea appreciation and sharing our knowledge about tea culture.

We aim to share the health benefits of tea drinking with our customers and aspire for our customers to appreciate our specially curated tea blends.

Our 2 product lines allow YOU to choose between a strong, aromatic kick or a delightful, blossoming infusion.

## Technologies Used ##
1. HTML, CSS
    - We used HTML & CSS to format, build (HTML) and style (CSS) TTS v2

    - Some examples of this includes the scroll up button that appears after scrolling down for a set number of pixels and the accordian for FAQs
3. Adobe XD
    - We used Adobe XD to design the wireframe and plan the UI overhaul regarding TTS v1 (The Tea Shop website from ASG1 built by Reginald)
4. Adobe Photoshop
     - We used Adobe Photoshop to alter the renders based on the requirements for this website (cropping, resolution control, scaling of image, colour balance)
5. Visual Studio Code
    - We used VS Code as our IDE for building TTS v2 (The Tea Shop built for ASG2)
6. Webfont Generator 
    - We imported our font CSS files into Webfont Generator and used it to import them into styles.css
7. Notion
    - We utilised Notion as a project management tool, making use of their Kanban board and Timeline visuals to track our progress and keep each other updated on individual task progress
    - Notion was also used for our lecturer to check-in on our progress from Day 1 and ensure constant and consistent progress
